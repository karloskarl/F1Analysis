# Group E10 - F1 Burning Questions
Our goal - to provide the Formula One community with compelling data science-backed answers to their most debate-worthy questions regarding F1 racing results. We are motivated by our own personal interest in the questions posed, as well as the results our work produces.

Welcome to our Repo! Here, you will find all the .csv files that are a part of our dataset as well as two Jupyter Notebook files containing all the code used to gather results. More info on the Notebook contents is provided in additional README and the notebooks themselves.
